  <h2><i class="fas fa-seedling icon"></i>Overview</h2>

  <p>The primary goal of the Environmental Science Club is to encourage students who are passionate about using science and technology to create a more sustainable future. The club will focus on understanding environmental issues like climate change, energy use, and resource management through means of research and creative problem-solving. Members can take part in projects and hackathons as part of the club.</p>

  <p>The club will also host coding hackathons related to environmental science and sustainability, which will give students the chance to make apps and tools that will address environmental issues. Joining the Environmental Science Club creates a positive impact in the community and it's also beneficial as you can win hackathons.</p>

  <p>Overall, environmental science is relevant regardless of your major.</p>
